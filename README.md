Write a function called merge that takes two already sorted lists of possibly different lengths, and merges them into a single sorted list. Do this without using the sort method.
Write a function called int_str that, given an integer less than 1015, returns the name of the integer in English. As an example, int_str(123456) should return one hundred twenty-three thousand, four hundred fifty-six.
Write a function called is_sorted that is given a list and returns True if the list is sorted and False otherwise. Do this without using the sort method.
Write a function called calculate_area that takes the radius of a circle as an argument. Inside the function, calculate the area of the circle (Ï€r^2) and print it. Test the function by calling it with different radius values.
Create a global variable called counter and initialize it with 0. Write a function called increment_counter that increments the value of counter by 1 and prints the updated value. Call the function multiple times and observe the changes in the global variable.
Write a function called outer_function that takes a parameter x. Inside outer_function, define another function called inner_function that multiplies x by a given factor. Call inner_function from outer_function and print the result.
Create a global variable called x and set it to 10. Write a function called my_function that defines a local variable with the same name x and assigns it a value of 20. Inside the function, print the local x variable and the global x variable. Call my_function and observe the output.
Write a function called power_of that takes a parameter n and returns a function called power that calculates the nth power of a given number. Test the power_of function by calling it with different values of n and then using the returned power function to calculate powers.
